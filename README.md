# Anthropomorphic-arm-with-Spherical-Wrist
Robot manipulators are commonly used in most of today's industrial applications. This usage only continues to grow as the technology improves, and as such, increases in relevancy as an area of research. In this report an anthropomorphic robot arm with spherical wrist was simulated in MATLAB. Through utilizing the Denavit-Hartenberg method along with forward and inverse kinematics, the robot’s end effector is able to reach a specified point in space. In today's industrial applications, robot manipulators are extensively employed. The most prevalent form of industrial robot is the anthropomorphic arm with spherical wrist robot. The anthropomorphic arm along with a spherical wrist and can do 'human-like' actions. The ability to operate the robot's shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints is necessary to accomplish these human qualities. As a result, the robotic arm is imbued with industrial expertise, allowing it to do tasks like "pick-and-place." The forward and inverse kinematics have been calculated, and mathematical solutions based on the D-H (Denavit–Hartenberg) parameters have been discussed in this report. The kinematics solution has been verified by solving the manipulator’s motion. Therefore, this report presents an efficient analytical computation procedure of both forward and inverse kinematics, and moreover we have done the simulation of the robot with MATLAB and robotics toolbox.
